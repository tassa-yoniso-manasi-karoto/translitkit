### Status: pre-release [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/tassa-yoniso-manasi-karoto/go-ichiran.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tassa-yoniso-manasi-karoto/go-ichiran) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/tassa-yoniso-manasi-karoto/translitkit)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/tassa-yoniso-manasi-karoto/translitkit)

This library primarily aims at **providing tokenization** and **phonetically-accurate transliteration**.

Currently, neural network-oriented NLP tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition... are not supported because I don't have a need for it but I am open to iterating on the current implementation if people want to contribute. Hence, I will keep this as "pre-release" but the tokenization/romanization APIs should be pretty stable.

I am not trying to reinvent the wheel therefore this library will leverage reputable implementations of (tokenizers+) romanizers for each language: either a go library or a ***dockerized component*** using the Docker Compose API (especially in the case of tokenizers or neural network based libraries).

**This library does not perform any kind of natural language processing by itself**, it only serves as a gateway to the underlying tokenizers/transliterators/NLP libs.

Thus there are linguistic annotations available following analysis such as part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization... **only if the underlying provider offers it and to the extent it provides it**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This library is ***not meant to slugifiy or transform a string into ASCII*** (i.e. to generate URLs).<br>
> You may use [gosimple/slug](https://github.com/gosimple/slug) or [mozillazg/go-unidecode](https://github.com/mozillazg/go-unidecode) for these.<br>
> go-unicode already ships a chinese tokenizer but other languages may benefit from using one of the tokenizer provided here though.


## Currently implemented tokenizers / transliterators
"combined" means the provider implement both.

## AI Doomer note
LLMs are perfectly suited for NLP.

Therefore all traditional NLP providers are on their way to becoming obsolete, included here under ‚Äútraditional‚Äù are even the neural network libraries based on BERT and even those based on ELECTRA.

However, there is still a case for using traditional providers such as morphological analyzers:
1) They are resource-effective, affordable, anyone can run it without any expense or expensive hardware.
2) They have maturity and thorough testing/fine-tuning by humans.

Because I am writing this library to provide bulk/mass transliteration of subtitle files on my project langkit, LLMs are not suitable. However they already outperform traditional providers in some cases.


Besides that, this library was extensively written by Claude Sonnet 24.10, which authored most of the code except for the most elaborate parts of the design. For the ichiran.go bindings, which involves just JSON parsing, it has authored probably 99% of the code under minimum supervision, most of it being zero-shot generation.

The CEO of Anthropic said in a [very interesting interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugvHCXCOmm4) back in November 24 there is no true roadblocks in sight and he speculates from the current curve AIs smarter than humans will exist within one or two years.

Dear professional programmers, you have a year or two before the job market becomes a sequel to Hunger Games. ü´°
